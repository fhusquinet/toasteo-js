# Toasteo JS
A simple Toast package that is lightweight (5kb~) with zero dependencies written in vanilla JS

## Getting started
#### [Install from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toasteo)
```
npm install --save-dev toasteo
```

#### In your JS file
```
import Toasteo from "toasteo";
window.Toasteo = new Toasteo({});
```

## Basic usage
There is four toasts ready to be used, a success toast, an error toast, a warning toast and an info toast. They all use the same syntax, the only difference is the style applied.

```
window.Toasteo.success('My success toast');
window.Toasteo.error('My error toast');
window.Toasteo.warning('My warning toast');
window.Toasteo.info('My info toast');
```

This all works by default using the provided CSS.

## Options
You can change the default options when initializing the package.
```
window.Toasteo = new Toasteo(options};
```
